title: AUTOTYPE Suggestion

How wonderful it feels when Internet explorer suggests names for URLs  when we start typing the first few letters!

Our mainframe also has the  ability to do pretty much the same. Using **KEYS** command on the command line, assign a free PF key with the value **AUTOTYPE**. We are all set.

Now  use 3.4 to go to the Data Set list utility and then type the first few  qualifier of the required data set. Press the desired PF key. It will  show you the dataset name which is nearest match.
