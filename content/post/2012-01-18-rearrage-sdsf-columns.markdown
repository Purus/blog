title: Rearrage SDSF Columns
---

If you want to rearrange the columns in SDSF.

- Go to SDSF;ST.

- In command line type "arr ?".

- This will bring the complete list of SDSF column names.

- You can move the columns using "/" and "//".

One Column in the SDSF that we can bring to the front position is the MAX-RC (which usually is the last column in SDSF) which shows the completion code or the abend code of the job.
